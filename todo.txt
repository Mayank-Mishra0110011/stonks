=> Write test case for opening && removing panels in every order possible with actual stonks this time {
  pass if:
    closed window = expected closed stonk window,
    opened window = expected opened stonk window,
    open panel count = panelData live object count
}
=> Plot candles and area
=> Save/Load state from json

=> Add indicators like tickers (check for data before loading) and add plotting for indicators
=> HTTP request for data will only be made again, if the window is refreshed or when 
intervals change AND are beyond what the data set has at that given instance
=> Preserve window data and ONLY redraw it on resize (no http requests!)
=> Re-bind dropdown callbacks on resize
=> Make each window expandable {
  keep things easier and expand to max width, no drag functionality (might consider adding later)
}
